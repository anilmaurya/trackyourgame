Track Your Game
=============

Idea:

User can create group of friends who play same games(invite them) 

Games are of two types
-> 2 player game
-> multi player game

2 player Game
-> After every game user enter who won, who loss
-> Assign points accordingly

Multi player Game
 -> Points earned by each player
 -> Points saved by each player
 Points will be Goal in case of Football

At any time users can view Rank among their group

Rank Calculation Logic:

Every person in group has associated point.
Every rank in group has associated point.

Suppose there are 10 person in a group
Person with rank 1 will have 10 point, so anyone who beats rank 1 person will earn 10 points
similarly person with rank 2 will have 9 point, so anyone who beats rank 2 person will earn 9 points

Rank will be based on no. of points person have.
